# Ojito Discoveries


## Background

The names of the sites we use were developed primarily based on what I think a basin or mesa resembled looking down from a view as in Google Earth. Locations such as "Jeffersons Nose" - to me - resemble the image of Thomas Jefferson on a nickle. "Mammoth Mesa" resembles the head , tusks and trunk of a wooly mammoth when observed from overhead.  Most of the data and images we collected were collected over the span of years form 2014 to 2022 or so.

Several images, video, and 3D scan sites are provided to get a better sense of our discoveries in the Ojito.

Let me share a little of why we love searching for dinosaur bones!  To put it simply - Its the THRILL of DISCOVERY!

## Ojito Petroglyphs
![PetroglyphsImage.png](images/PetroglyphsImage.png)

The petroglyphs in the Ojito Wilderness, estimated to be around 1,000 years old, are scattered along the edge of a mesa in its southeast corner and are the most extensive in the area. Discovering them requires effort, as their exact location is not widely shared, adding to the sense of accomplishment upon finding them. Standing on the ledge where they are inscribed, the author reflects on the ancient artist who etched these stories into the rock, imagining the timeless landscape and feeling a poignant connection to a fellow human from a distant past.  We have even found pottery sherds with juman fingerprints on them!

## The McConnell sites (I and II)
Described by [Hilde L. Schwartz and Kim Manley in "Geology and stratigraphy of the Seismosaurus locality, Sandoval County, New
Mexico"](https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/14/n2/nmg_v14_n2_p25.pdf).  

#### McConnell I (MCI)
*"MCI consists of an accumulation of disarticulated skeletal elements, including ribs, teeth, vertebrae, one tooth, and one gastrolith in situ. The bones represent at least two individuals, a sauropod and a carnosaur Gillette, 1991). They are at the base of a short, steep slope in a silty olive claystone that crops out 2.8 km southeast of SSI. The MCI stratum is part of a thick floodplain overbank sequence that is near the top of the Brushy Basin Member."*

In our adventures we have found more and larger finds in MCII but MCI does have an apparent "end of an Allosaurid fibula" - or did - we tried to place it out of harms way (floods) protected by a larger boulder - but the last three trips have proven we can no longer find this bone, it very well was likely washed down the arroyo - we still have pictures and video!

#### McConnell II (MCII)
*"Only 0.1 km south-southeast of MCI, the MCII site is stratigraphically 13 m higher than its neighbor. One large bone and numerous bone flakes and fragments (unidentified to date) are exposed here. They are eroding from a dark reddish-brown siltstone_bed that is part of the same floodplain-overbank complex as MCI."*

MCII sports a couple of large splintering bones eroding out from red claystone. The larger appears to be a large head of rib of a sauropod of some kind.

Ben took a picture form a few hundred yard away of this lonesome looking old snarly juniper tree.  Later in the day, when we were passing sloce by, Ben starting finding grapfruit size pieces of bone, and when we followed it to its source - we discovered this partial sauropod femur. You can see the lonely tree in this video - its roots helping to hold the femur in place!

Here's a video showing the discovery!

From Burro mesa area - quite a few Allosaurus bits!

Rotate the boulder with a a mouse and zoom in or out with a scroll wheel, or translate with a SHIFT Mouse until you can clearly view the darker gray carpal bone of an allosaur!


### Burro mesa Fib and Frags

Rotate the boulder down 90 degrees with a a mouse and zoom in or out with a scroll wheel, or translate with a SHIFT Mouse until you can clearly view the partially exposed claw of an allosaur! Now in the New Mexico Museum of Natural Hostory Annex!

### Burro mesa - Allosaurus Claw!

Rotate the iage about 30 degrees downward to see the FIbula tip and other frags we placed on top of the boulder

Burro mesa - here is a possible tooth in situ. Zoom in, and translate the image downward - look for white bone or tooth near top of boulder.

We showed a designated NMMNH museum collector who has BLM permission to colelct where our allosaurus find was, and we got to help him excavate this limb from the boulder and deposit in the Museum Annex.

The first bone we ALMOST found and much later stumbled upon for the win. Early in 2014 Ben, Sam and I explored the area referred to as Cary (from the whitepaper noted above). Both boys asked me how to tell if they were looking at bone and I told them to "scrutinize anything different". Ben stood right next to a small juniper tree drinking water that day - and missed these bones right at his feet. Several years later Ben and I re-scanned the area and made this discovery!
