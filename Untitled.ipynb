    "\n",
    "The names of the sites we use were developed primarily based on what I think a basin or mesa resembled looking down from a view as in Google Earth. Locations such as \"Jeffersons Nose\" - to me - resemble the image of Thomas Jefferson on a nickel. \"Mammoth Mesa\" resembles the head , tusks and trunk of a wooly mammoth when observed from overhead.  Most of the data and images we have were collected over the span of years form 2014 to 2022 or so.\n",

    "Several images, video, and 3D scan sites are provided to get a better sense of our discoveries in the Ojito.\n",

    "\n",
    "The petroglyphs in the Ojito Wilderness, estimated to be around 1,000 years old, are scattered along the edge of a mesa in its southeast corner and are the most extensive in the area. Discovering them requires effort, as their exact location is not widely shared, adding to the sense of accomplishment upon finding them. Standing on the ledge where they are inscribed, the author reflects on the ancient artist who etched these stories into the rock, imagining the timeless landscape and feeling a poignant connection to a fellow human from a distant past.  We have even found pottery sherds with human fingerprints on them!\n",

    "*\"MCI consists of an accumulation of disarticulated skeletal elements, including ribs, teeth, vertebrae, one tooth, and one gastrolith in situ. The bones represent at least two individuals, a sauropod and a carnosaur Gillette, 1991). They are at the base of a short, steep slope in a silty olive claystone that crops out 2.8 km southeast of SSI. The MCI stratum is part of a thick floodplain overbank sequence that is near the top of the Brushy Basin Member.\"*\n",

    "In our adventures we have found more and larger finds in MCII but MCI does have an apparent \"end of an Allosaurus fibula\" - or did - we tried to place it out of harms way (floods) protected by a larger boulder - but the last three trips have proven we can no longer find this bone, it very well was likely washed down the arroyo - we still have pictures and video!\n",

    "I dubbed Mammoth mesa based on the shape of interconnecting mesa and knob which taken together resemble the profile of a mammoth head, tusk, and trunk.  We have discovered HUNDREDS of bone fragments in situ in the cliff or in land-slid boulders here. Multiple species but most likely allosaurus and diplodocus bits but likely others as well.\n",

We got excellent photos of it before it took cover under a large boulder. The encounter slowed our progress throughout the day as we climbed up and over and around boulder after boulder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right about the time Sam detected the snake we were finding lots of bone fragments on the southern and western faces of the mesa.  After the encounter we also discovered a very nice red split sauropod vertebrae in float - the size of a bowling ball!\n",

    "During such an excursion in July 2015, Ben and I discovered an amazing number and variety of bones. As we pressed on again 12 noon and to about 1PM we were hurrying to get back across the arroyo.
